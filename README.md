# Firebase HTTPS receiver for Lightbug API quickstart

## Introduction

The function `lbListener` is created to receive HTTP POST messages from LB API.

The URL of this function, eg:
```
https://us-central1-AAAA-BBBBB.cloudfunctions.net/lbListener
```
Should be used in the register_push example as the endpoint value

## Initial setup, build tools and dependencies

### 1. Clone this repo

Clone or download this repo and navigate into the directory

### 2. Install the Firebase CLI and enable Functions on your Firebase CLI

You need to have installed the Firebase CLI. If you haven't run:

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

> Doesn't work? You may need to [change npm permissions](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions).

Login to firebase (if not already done) using
```bash
firebase login
```

### 3. Create a Firebase project and configure the quickstart

Create a Firebase Project on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com).


Set up your Firebase project by running `firebase use --add`, select your Project ID and follow the instructions.




## Deploy the app to prod

First you need to install the `npm` dependencies of the functions:

```bash
cd functions && npm install; cd ..
```

This installs dependencies locally

Deploy to Firebase using the following command:

```bash
firebase deploy
```

This deploys and activates the lbListener Function.

> The first time you call `firebase deploy` on a new project with Functions will take longer than usual.
